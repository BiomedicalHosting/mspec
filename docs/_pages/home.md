### Welcome to the mspec project!
The aim of this project is to investigate a stable alternative to the .msp file format used by NIST to distribute spectral libraries. A successful outcome would be a proposed standard which would enable 3rd parties (and NIST itself) to more easily incorporate .msp files into web pages, web-based applications and even desktop and server-side software.

### Towards a .mspec standard
The overall plan is to suggest a variation on the .msp format which will be distinguished by a new suffix (.mspec), and should remain relatively similar in terms of syntax and structure. There should be a straightfoward mechanism to translate this text-based format into .json and .xml representation for compatibility with modern web-based technology stacks.

### Formalizing the "comments" component of the .msp format
Part of the move towards .mspec is to better characterize the valid meta-data which has been incorporated to date, in order to better manage the decision regarding which fields will be supported and under what constraints (e.g. limitation by data type, format or controlled vocabulary).
